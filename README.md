# Singer 20u33 Servo Positioner Adapter
Everything you need to retrofit your Singer 20u33 (and clones) with a servo needle positioner.

## Overview
The Singer 20U33 / 20-33 and clones are industrial sewing machines that utilize a hand clutch to disengate / engage the sewing mechanism from the bobbin winder.  This allows the operator to wind bobbins without running the sewing mechanism.  This style handwheel is also found in many vintage Singer sewing machines such as the 66/99, featherweight and others.  Although these domestic machines are not really canidates for attaching an industrial servo, the technique outlined here should work.  Afterall, someone is bound to find a ~reason~ excuse to retrofit one sooner or later.

### But 'Why?", Servos and Industrial Clutch Motors
Industrial sewing machines have historically used powerful AC motors spinning at all times, and a foot clutch to engage the drive pully.  This arrangement is fantastic for highly skilled operators.  The amount of on-demand power is amazing, and with skill the speed can be controled with high precision.

For the rest of us, these beasts (I can barely lift the motor it is so heavy) are intimidating, noisy and difficult to control.

Servos on the other hand work a lot like a domestic foot pedal.  Press the pedal and the motor spins.  However, if a needel positioner is installed two other features are available.  
 1. The servo can be configured to always stop with the needle in the DOWN position.  This is handy for making tight turns.  The needle keeps the work item aligned, and thread tension is preserved.  Stop sewing, lift the foot, turn the material, lower the foot and continue sewing.
 2. The servo can be configured to bring the needle to the UP position by pressing on the heel of the foot pedal.  Stop the machine, press your heel against the bottom of the pedel and the needle lifts out of the way and into the thread release position.

Both of these operations are highly repeatable and reliable.

If these two capabilites don't sound like a big deal you are either not the target audiance (you are likely a professional), or haven't used an industrial machine with a servo yet.  Because once you do, boy-howdy, there is no going back.

I researched off-the-shelf adapters to mounting a position sensor without any luck.  Which led me to design my own 3D printed solution and share it here.  

Enjoy!

## Requirements
1. Inexpensive.
2. Easy.
3. Non-destructive.  Don't replace or modify any part of the machine.
4. The position sensor expects a certain shape and size barrel to attach to.  The barrel must be mounted on the main shaft.  Make it happen.
